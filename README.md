This project is a DIY version of the lovebox but I've had fun programming it myself so it has a few specific functions in addition to the fact that the data is encrypted and transits via servers I can choose and also a telegram bot that can notify the user that they've received something if they haven't opened the box after a certain amount of time. The advantage of this project is that I control the transit of the data and I'm certain that it's encrypted (although I think I'm going to have fun encrypting it with AES and RSA). Anyway... all that to say that this code is open-souce and that it's totally modular according to your needs. The 3D files will be added in a moment as well as the code(s) for esp32. [Many thanks to MAKE IT FOR LESS for the idea and for the code on which I based myself at the beginning]
